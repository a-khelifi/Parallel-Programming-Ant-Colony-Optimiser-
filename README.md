# Parallel-Programming-Ant-Colony-Optimiser-

•	Scope (Distributed Computing): Implemented a programme to vectorise, then, parallelise a plain code for the Ant Colony Optimisation algorithm. </br>
•	Case: 8 agents were used to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem for up to 8000 cities. 
•	The package used: Python (NumPy, Multiprocessing). </br>
•	Used built-in NumPy methods (e.g. np.argmax) for vectorisation. </br>
•	Used a Queue object to parallelise the workload on 8 processes. </br>
•	Results: achieved an average performance speedup of around 108.
